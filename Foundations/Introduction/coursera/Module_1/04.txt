Guidance in Applying for Continuing Education or Professional Development Credit
Continuing education or professional development credit is a necessity for many different specialties and disciplines.  Although there is no way to issue a universally recognized credit for completing the Learning How to Learn MOOC, Coursera issues certificates that are widely recognized.  The certificate won’t guarantee you’ll be granted credit by your district, institution, or organization. However, a good approach is for you to submit your certificate, along with the course syllabus, for potential approval by your home institution or organization.
