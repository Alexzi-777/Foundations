    learn more be learning more 

    some ideas relate to other 

because we can learn by transfer, we get two methods of solving a problem

sequential and intuitive

sequential follows a sequence in focus mode to solve a problem 

intuitive follows a loose connection of chunks that leads to an answer

    this answer must be verified  

the law of serendipity 

    lady luck favors the one that tries

    you might feel like there are too many problems to solve 

    but if you tackle that first problem 

    the second one will feel easier

    and then the next will be easier, and so on
