Illusions of compentence 

recall is how we know we actually learned something 

highlighting can make is think we are learning more, but all we are actually doing is moving more. 

try to get the big picture while listening and recall what you can remember 

if you are just listening or looking at a solution, and don't try to recall anything 

you probably wont retain anything 

actually doing the work and making the occasional mistake is the only way to move 

those ideas into a long term memory
