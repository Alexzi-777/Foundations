summary

chunk is like a neural path 

built with 
    focus attention 
    understanding 
    practice

recall 
    best way to help chunk process
    learn in different environments 

transfer 
    one chunk can help you learn different chunks 
    
interleave 
    practice all your different techniques in one session 

illusions of compentence in learning 
    test yourself
    minimize highlighting 
    mistakes are good 
    use deliberate practice

    Correct
Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and often through meaning. They can be large and complex, but still take up only one slot in your working memory. Chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding and practice.

Other important ideas from this section are recall, transfer, interleaving, illusions of competence and einstellung.

interview Dr. Norman Fortenberry

    you need to be part of a group

    you need to have access to your resources 

    find a team 

intiimidated 

    im not less smart just because ive entered a smarter community 

    remember the objective 

    keep you eye on the prize 

advanced calculus 

    hardship and failure
    
        balance ego 

    inform your opinions before you choices 

    what is a resonable choice and what is not a reasonable choice 

diffuse mode 

    keep your nose to the grindstone too long 

    take a break
        
    total mental turn off 

    read cartoons, watch shows 

    turn off consious 

    exercise maybe 

siblings and friends 

    not helping others? 

    systematic process for aquiring info 

    recall 

    input modes 

    saturate yourself with learning modes 

    internalize material 

    multi-mode input is important for learning 

    teaching is a great way to learn

    challenge 

        validate or resolve what you thought 

    take your time to teach it 


Scott young - the Marco Polo of learning 

4 years of CS into 1 year of learning 

avoid illusions of compentence in learning 

    dive into the mistakes immediately as possible 

    test comprehension 

    problem sets 

    tension is how you remember that problem in the future 

self explanation 

    fynmann technique 

    academic paper 

        it was hard to understand 

        read thru carefully and understand all the parts 

    learn like you are going to teach it 

        when you have friciton, thats what you dont understand 

    dont fool yourself - you are the easiest person to fool 

abstractions

    brain loves concrete ideas 

    makes anaolgies 

    jigsaw piece into problems 

    electricity anology 

        its like pipes with water 

        current is water flowing 

        voltage is like height, so pipes are physically higher potential different 

motivation 

    learning languages - 6th 

    time constraint 

    maybe a natural talent? 

    nope - "D" 

    being intelligent relates to exposure to subject 

    motivation comes from improvement

    learn from failure 

    dont let yourself be set back by 

projects for self education 

    benny louis

    always have a mission 

    3 month missions 

    would it be possible to learn MIT concepts faster than a student at MIT 

    grand projects , or small projects 

online resources 

    MOOC 

    future of education 

    early days 

    lots of subjects 

    disadvantages 

        moocs are to easy or general 

        physics might not be great 
    
    use MIT open course 

    some aren't great, maybe no videos 

    but maybe they'll have exams and stuff 

    be adventerous 

learn more study less 

    low efficiency low intensity study habits

    more study, less efficiency 

    you need to workout more intensly 

    pick specific chunks of times to study 

    anki and convos (language)

    you can relax outside those times
